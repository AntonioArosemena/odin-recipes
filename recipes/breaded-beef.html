  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Our all-time favorite meat item! Everybody who has ever had this has flipped out! It's so easy and make extra and <br>
    freeze it for a meal in 5 minutes. Give it a try -- I promise you won't be disappointed! Serve with a squeeze of <br>
    lemon -- fantastic hot or at room temperature. 
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 pounds beef rump roast</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>4 cups dry bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Place the beef roast into the freezer for several hours, until very firm and almost frozen.<br> 
      Slice the beef about 1/8 inch thick across the grain. You can also ask the butcher to slice it <br>
      very thinly for you.</p>

    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Whisk the eggs and water together in a bowl. Spread the bread crumbs out onto a large sheet of aluminum foil, <br>
      and sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and Parmesan cheese. Mix all the crumb ingredients together until well combined. <br>
      Dip each piece of beef into the egg mixture, then thoroughly coat with crumbs. Place the coated slices onto a sheet of <br>
      foil on a baking sheet, and separate them with waxed paper as you dip and coat the beef.</p>

    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy skillet until shimmering, and pan-fry the beef slices until golden brown, <br>
      about 2 minutes on the first side and 1 minute on the second side. Fry 2 or 3 slices per batch.</p>
